        content: 'A new book is aiming to educate vegan children about common misconceptions about the lifestyle, while giving them the tools to respond to criticism. Titled 50 Comebacks For Vegan Kids, the book explores 50 common myths about the plant-based diet in terms of health, the planet, and animals. Solomon Tadlock, the 12-year-old son of renowned plant-based physician Brooke Goldner, wrote the book.       Goldner is a best-selling author who says that she reversed lupus on a plant-based diet. She has written two books endorsing the benefits of animal-free eating, Goodbye Autoimmune Disease and Goodbye Lupus. Taking to Instagram to post about her son‚Äôs recent TV appearance on Houston channel KPRC-TV, she said she was ‚Äúso proud‚Äù of his achievement. She explained that he wrote it to ‚Äúhelp empower kids against bullies and also as a resource for information about the science that backs up the benefits of eating plants for health, animals, and the planet.',
